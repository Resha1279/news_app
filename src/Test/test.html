<div><p>We&#8217;ve already had a close look at the likely design of the <a
        href="https://www.techradar.com/news/razer-phone-2-release-date-news-leaks">Razer Phone 2</a> from the front,
    and now a new leaked render seemingly shows it from both the front and the back, highlighting some differences to
    the original <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/razer-phone-review">Razer Phone</a>.</p>
    <p>We say seemingly because as ever with a leak it might not be accurate, but the image comes from <a
            href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1045535259415244800" target="_blank">Evan Blass</a>, who has a good
        track record.</p>
    <p>The most interesting aspect of the back is the green Razer logo, which Blass claims lights up, making for a
        rather showier look than the plain white logo on the original Razer Phone.</p>
    <p>The dual-lens rear camera is also in a different position here, as it&#8217;s more central than the camera on its
        predecessor, which sat towards the top left corner.</p>

    <p>Otherwise the back of the Razer Phone 2 shown here is a plain black slab, much as it was on the Razer Phone,
        though it&#8217;s possibly a bit darker here.&#160;</p>
    <p>The front also looks virtually identical, complete with large speakers above and below the display. This also
        matches up with an <a
                href="https://www.techradar.com/news/razer-phone-2-will-look-almost-identical-to-original-according-to-leaked-image">earlier
            leaked render</a>.</p>
    <p>It&#8217;s worth noting that there&#8217;s no sign of a fingerprint scanner, which could mean the Razer Phone 2
        has one built into the screen, but the original Razer Phone has one built into the power key on the side of the
        handset, so it&#8217;s just as likely that&#8217;s the case again here.</p>
    <p>In any case, we&#8217;ll know soon, as the company is officially unveiling the Razer Phone 2 on <a
